DTXMLRPC
========

This project provides some simple wrappers around XML-RPC requests and responses. Based on that an example implementation for the Wordpress XML-RPC API is provided.

Contains DTBase64Coding from DTFoundation. If you plan to use both let me know so that we can make a static library that excludes this class.
